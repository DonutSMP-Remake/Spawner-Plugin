## Features

*   **Virtual Storage**: Items and XP are stored inside the spawner instead of being dropped on the ground (Anti-Lag).
*   **Spawner Stacking**: Stack spawners to increase production rates in a single block.
*   **Economy Integration**: Sell items directly from the GUI (requires Essentials).
*   **Isolation Bonus**: Spawners produce faster if they are not placed directly next to others.
*   **Natural Spawners**: Configurable whether naturally generated spawners (dungeons) become virtual or remain vanilla.
*   **Fully Configurable**: All messages, GUI titles, prices, and intervals can be changed in `config.yml`.
